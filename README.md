Displays changes to excess mortality subsequent to the CoVid mass vaccination program, under the auspices of Humanity Projects:

"The Covid-19 crisis led to several alterations in individuals' lifestyles and perceptions of risk for their day-to-day choices. It is important to contextualise the magnitude of impact of the pandemic so that lessons can be learned, and policy can be chosen that is based on the most accurate numbers possible. In this context, measuring excess deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (as well as policy interventions) is of high relevance.

Recent statistics from different national statistical offices are showing higher levels of deaths than would be expected (excess deaths). These statistical calculations are, in most cases, performed by comparing deaths in 2020, 2021 and 2022 with prior average deaths before 2020. Typically, excess deaths are reported as deviations from previous 5-year or 3-year averages in deaths (the baseline). Even though these comparisons provide a baseline for computing excess deaths, their accuracy can be compromised by changing population numbers as well as changing death rates.

In this report we estimate excess mortality by computing changes in death rates in relation to a given baseline instead of changes in deaths."
